# DevOps Platform Capstone

## Project Purpose
Build a fully automated DevOps platform using Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins,
Docker, SonarQube, and Nexus.

## Core Rules
- No manual server configuration
- No UI-based infrastructure creation
- No secrets in code
- Pipeline stops on failures
- Everything must be reproducible

## High-Level Flow
Terraform → Infrastructure  
Ansible → Configuration  
Jenkins → CI/CD  
Docker Host → Build  
SonarQube → Quality  
Nexus → Artifacts  

## Standards
Detailed project standards and phases are documented in:
docs/standards-and-phases.md
